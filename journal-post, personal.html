                <p>It's funny — the duality of time, or rather my perception of it. Obsess about it fastidiously, in an anxious fervour, terrified of letting it slip away and attempting to make the most of it oddly enough lets it slip away because the anxiety clouds your focus, leaving you with a subpar level of concentration that you think is your norm/best(the latter being a much more gutting blow to your ego), challenging your self-perception and worth and at best, leaving you to do low-energy tasks like email-sorting, glancing your eyes over a piece of text or eating voraciously to avoid noticing the previous things. Simply put, the more desperately you try to cling, the later you realise you're gripping sand. </p>
<p>Something I've come to deeply dislike and am pretty convinced holds me back is caring too much about insignificant things; bare in mind that my view of what is insignificant has widened to encompass a lot more I previously wouldn't have been willing to part with. You try too hard to be grateful and caring and all it ultimately leads to is you trying your darndest to prove to everyone else but mostly yourself that you are indeed that. It becomes an act, so riddled with invisible artifice it now makes my skin crawl a bit thinking about it. The Good Place said it best : you can't be getting points for goodwill if that's the reason you do it. There is a certain beauty and harness-loosening that comes with giving up control and over-thinking about stuff that's normal and should be second-nature to you now. Thinking only in meta can be more damaging than you think (something you should have seen coming, considering who runs it).</p>
<p>It is somewhat shameful that it's only now I realise a huge chunk of my life, in fact most of it dare I say, is just pretence and slipping into what seems to be a character — this persona I've built. Pretending to be working or doing something of importance when I'm not, focusing on my peripheral vision and distracting myself instead of actually focusing on work; pretending to be getting along fine to other people when the ghost of inactivity and sloth looms large over me. Feeling smug and proud of myself of using certain words that may not be in common parlance, and while I do think there was a place for it when I was young (in fact, it may have been crucial in developing my penchant for language and literature), it's time to shed off these childish, long over-stayed animas.</p>
<p>Also, don't attach more import than is due to these, what are ultimately trivialities — which doesn't mean you ignore them altogether or ignore checking in on days that you feel were bad ones — it means you don't think about more than you should on the bad days and again don't get on your high horse or enter pride territory on the good ones. These are just things that keep you in a good enough state to accomplish the more important things. Much like chores — you hate them because they're repetitive, self-renewing tasks: what's the point in doing them? I don't know — you don't get a gold star for doing them or anything; it may seem like drudgery. In fact, how do you stop looking at them like drudgery when you know in the grand scheme of things — they don't matter. In fact, it's especially easy not to do them on the good days and that's how the cycle starts. </p>
<p>Your life is not a movie nor are you the centre-piece, star or prima donna of it. It does not unfold like a story at least not while it's happening and treating it like it is is dangerious. Stories can only be constructed in retrospect; dangerous because you're assured of some sort of resolution, or if you're lucky, a hopeful and good ending. But stories leave out is the mundane, gruelling everyday tide you so tirelessly push back against. Sure, most may deem it insignificant in the grand scale of life but for someone who struggles to do even simple tasks like washing a coffee cup, it seems like it's truly these moments that matter — everything else is a whirl. Don't get me wrong — you do need to step back from time to time to re-evaluate and that's a good sanity check, both literally and figuratively. </p>
<p>Something that I read recently in the reply section of a Reddit post bemoaning not wanting to resort to speeed reading as it a hollow experience and contending with the harsh reality that one will not be able to read all the books in the world, was that someone increased their reading speed naturally by being a voracious reader from their very infancy — something about that straightforward, no-nonsense attitude with which they proclaimed that they just read — just got down to it, with or without listening to music, getting a hot beverage etc...when it comes down to it, you realise in a world where I am so used to my comforts, the people who really do <em>do it</em> don't need all this fluff that you convince yourself are neccesities, or worse yet bemoan their loss, thinking about them afterwards. The simple truth is — You don't need that stuff either; it's just excuses and the tragedy, is simply being self-aware is not enough. It has to reflect in your actions.</p>
<p>Another thing that you wanted to make good on was the fact that you identify and care so much about emotions you seem to be experiencing that they reign supreme and control you, instead of the other way round; to such an extent and degree because you think it's the most pertinent thing about you and you need to preserve it. Truth be said you've donned this identity for too long; in order to make progress in other areas you need to let go of this and truly focus on the things that you think matter now. Also, talking too much without you actually doing any of the stuff (white-lies) and talking with too much zeal about things that are in the big scheme inconsequential is bringing you down; also, because you imagine and fantasize about them more than just letting them be moments in the wind. Funnily enough, just the repudiation thought of you telling yourself not to think about something is very distracting so you need to be more in control of your mind to the extent those thoughts don't arise and this is much easier said than done — it can, I imagine, only be achieved by continuous, sustained bouts of meditation. More importantly, all of this has stemmed from an identity crisis you've had about whether you truly want to continue in sciene or select a more accomodating venture that includes writing, since that's something you feel you'll not get bored of, discouraged about, something that comes from the inside that you're more sure won't be deterred by external forces and circumstances. If that's the case, you need to really zero in on this, practicing day in and day out continuously because as you read — it'll take around the order of at least 5 years to reach some respectable place where you'll be confident enough and good enough. I suppose an important aspect of all of this and something that will definitely benefit my mental well-being is not giving up on writing (because that's one area that I think I challenge myself — need to do it more truth be told though) and working within time constraints and realising my limitations and abilities — I can't be the best of the best, I can't even allow myself the luxury of time to do everything the way I imagine it to be, doing everything meticulously and covering all my bases — I need to realise your best is rarely the best you imagine yourself achieveing; it's more something that slowly comes together under pressure and single-minded focus of doing enough and gauging the enough is a mammoth mind-boggling task, but it's something that feels like instinct — like feeling whether something is lighter or heavier — it can't be taught and it can't be calibrated mentally beforehand, try as hard as you may. At this point I may just be rambling and reiterating but even stuff where I berate myself, perhaps even tells other about it, for not being able to do something or not doing something I think I 'should' be doing yet don't — just don't engage in that sort of behaviour. As harmless/innocuous as it may seem, it slowly corrodes you from the inside; you want to have an ice-cream: fine, go crazy. Don't debate the morality of it. What's the hope? That you'll someday decide not to have it, without any long-drawn argument in your head; simply because you think - 'Nah'. Simple as that; but this is important — you can't fake this, meaning you can't go and secretly think — Man, I did this because that implies you made an effort or some sort of sacrifice; it wasn't really natural then, was it. And I used to think this doesn't matter; As long as you achieve the desired results, how does it matter the way you got there, but man it really does. Also, don't attach more import than is due to these, what are ultimately trivialities — which doesn't mean you ignore them altogether or ignore checking in on days that you feel were bad ones — it means you don't think about more than you should on the bad days and again don't get on your high horse or enter pride territory on the good ones. These are just things that keep you in a good enough state to accomplish the more important things. Much like chores — you hate them because they're repetitive, self-renewing tasks: what's the point in doing them? I don't know — you don't get a gold star for doing them or anything; it may seem like drudgery.
